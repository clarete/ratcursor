This is a simple program to discover where's the mouse cursor and select
the frame above it.

To make it work, download ratcursor (I guess you have already did it if
you're reading it). compile it with a simple `make'.

After that, install xbindkeys and add the following lines to the
~/.xbindkeysrc config file:

  "ratcursor"
    Control + b:1

After that, just start xbindkeys and be happy. Hold Control and click to
select a ratpoison frame. :)

This program was heavly based on the clickframe.pl script by Shawn
Betts. I've wrote ratcursor because of two reasons:

 * I didn't know `ratpoison -c ratinfo'
 * I was needing to write some cool program in C to make my day better
